# asautils
Package with some useful features.

Steps to install:
1. Rename 'installconfig_template.json' to 'installconfig.json' and edit it with correct path
2. Run 'install.py'

Other modules required:
- cryptograpthy (serialization)
- colorama (compare, logger)

To install that modules you need to type 'pip install <modulename>' in command line. If it doesn't work, then try reading/watching package installing tutorials.

Also I'm really new with sharing my code, so it's not available on PyPi yet.
