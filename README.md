# asautils
Package with some useful features.

Im sure that ```pip install https://github.com/Asapros/asautils/archive/BRANCH.zip``` would work for installing the package
(replace 'BRANCH' with branch name; currently 'main' or 'test')

Also I'm really new with sharing my code, so it's not available on PyPi yet.
